### Hi, it's Lucas, a tech lover from fr_FR ðŸ‘‹

This account is here to build *proof of concetp* and *working demos*. Some can be useful and should go further, if you feel it's the case, don't hesitate to reach me out or send a PR.

I work almost exclusively in JavaScript because I'm loving it, special thanks to all the people makng this commmunity so thrilling !

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects like a static site generator wrapped in Electron, a CLI to handle checklists or a loan calculator.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning micro frontends padradigm.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I believe that high-tech has no future but still I continue to work in this sector.
- ðŸ¤” More seriously : I think low tech and local / decentralized systems are the way to go
